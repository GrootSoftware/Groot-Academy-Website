        <h4>How to Become a Software Engineer After 12th: Overview</h4>

        <p class="mb-0">There are, mainly, two ways to gain expertise in Software Engineering.<br><br>

        First and foremost choices are pursuing courses like BTech/ BSc Computer Science, BCA as
            well as other short-term courses like Diploma in Computer Science, Diploma in Computer
            Application and Diploma in Software Engineering, amongst others.<br><br>

        The alternative way is to undertake intensive training programmes which focus on particular
            aspects of software engineering, for instance, programming languages, design and network and
            security, etc.<br><br>

        While the former provides a more comprehensive understanding, the latter is skill-oriented and
            emphasizes the practical aspect. Here are major things that can help you in your pursuit.</p>
